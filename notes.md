* Split into two parts:
1) can we execute skeleton without truth values under both (without error?)?
2) take known non-error files and try to solve for constants
* What to do with non-fatal errors?
* TODO
1) Sequence terminated early
2) Comment directives?
3) BitVec index vs Int
4) z3 doesnt understand incremental, cvc4 needs it sometimes
