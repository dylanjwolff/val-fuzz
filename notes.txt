Wrapping everything in an ASTNode means you need to add an extra catch-all to all the matching...

Could dynamically add it for iteration only as pushing onto a stack...

QF_AUF not supported

(set-info :status sat)

match statements

sampling rather than iteration

other booleans from parameterized fns (e.g. A->A ) when we know one operand is bool

switch to visitor pattern / iteration

match expressions

changes problem structure... e.g. x*4 -> x*GEN1  is now non-linear arithmetic, instead of linear... should we just use all available?
