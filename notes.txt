Wrapping everything in an ASTNode means you need to add an extra catch-all to all the matching...

Could dynamically add it for iteration only as pushing onto a stack...

Should just convert everything to Strings instead of str slices... the conversion will happen eventually, and doing these manipulations mixing lifetimes and owned data is really painful
